# Touch Target Guidelines

- Minimum hit area: 44px height and width where possible.
- Buttons: use `py-3` on primary CTAs, `py-2.5` on secondary, add `min-w-[44px]` for icon-only controls.
- Icons: wrap in buttons/anchors with padding; avoid bare icons as controls.
- Spacing: use `gap-2`+ between adjacent controls to avoid mis-taps.
