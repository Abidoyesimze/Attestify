### Chat Connected to Dashboard Functions

```typescript
<AIChat
  vaultBalance={balanceDisplay}          // Real-time vault balance
  currentAPY={apyDisplay}                // Live APY from contract
  currentStrategy={userStrategy}         // Active strategy
  earnings={earningsDisplay}             // Total earnings
  onDeposit={handleDeposit}             // Executes deposit flow
  onWithdraw={handleWithdraw}           // Executes withdrawal
  onStrategyChange={handleStrategyChange} // Changes strategy
/>
```

### Real-Time Data Flow

## 📊 Example Conversations

### Portfolio Query
```
User: "What's my balance?"

AI: 📊 Your Attestify Portfolio:

• Vault Balance: 100.00 cUSD
• Total Earnings: 2.50 cUSD
• Current APY: 3.5%
• Strategy: Conservative

You're earning approximately $0.0096 per day!
```

### Strategy Advice
```
User: "Should I change my strategy?"

AI: Based on your portfolio analysis:

Current: Conservative (100% Moola, 0% reserve)
Balance: 100 cUSD
Earnings: 2.50 cUSD (2.5% ROI)

Recommendations:
1. Continue with Conservative if prioritizing safety
2. Consider Balanced for slightly more flexibility
3. Growth strategy for maximum yield potential

Your current strategy is performing well. No immediate changes needed.
```

### Risk Analysis
```
User: "What are the risks?"

AI: 🛡️ Risk Analysis:

**Your Current Strategy: Conservative**

• Smart Contract Risk: Audited vault contract
• Protocol Risk: Moola Market is established on Celo
• Liquidity Risk: Very Low (100% deployed)
• Market Risk: Stablecoin (cUSD) minimizes volatility

✅ Overall: Your funds are relatively safe, earning stable yields.
